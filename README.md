# Peer-2-Peer-Group-based-File-Sharing-System
This application is used to share files among your peers. You just make a group and start uploading files for all participants to download. It uses socket programming and multithreading. The file is downloaded in multiple chunks from multiple peers simultaneously and uses SHA to verify the downloaded file integrity.
